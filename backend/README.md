# FAIR CC Backend

The backend is in NestJS and with a PostgreSQL database.

It also uses Nodemailer to send the emails.

As it's my first NestJS app I have been playing around a bit while I learned how to get this project done, so I also left some CRUD queries and mutations in case you want to use them. Enjoy XD

## Project setup

Take a look at `.env.example` to see how to create your `.env` file on the `backend` project directory.

To serve the backend, from the `backend` project directory, you can run:

### `npm i && npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
