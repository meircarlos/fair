# FAIR CC Backend

The backend is in NodeJS and ExpressJS.

It uses Agenda as a Job Scheduler for handling the reminders logic.

And Nodemailer to send the emails.

## Project setup

To serve the backed, from the `backend` project directory, you can run:

### `npm i && npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
