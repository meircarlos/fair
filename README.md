The frontend and the backend are splitted into different projects: `frontend` and `backend`.

Each project contains its own `README.md` file explaining how to run it.

There is also a directory named `nestjs-backend`. It's incomplete, I started working on it even though I have never used before NestJS. Due to that I couldn't figure out how to properly set a provider asynchronously to pass the `agenda` dependency I decided to stop working on this version and proceed with the `backend` version. I will leave it here in case you want to give it a look.
