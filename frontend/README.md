# FAIR CC Frontend

The frontend is awful, it's just a quick implementation to play with the backend (jeje)

To serve the frontend, from the `frontend` project directory, you can run:
### `npm i && npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The first time you run it with the backend it will populate 6 collections so that you can play around with them.
